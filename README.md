# README

This project was an exploration of Rails during my time in module 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. The project was inspired by sister who is a special education major. The purpose of the application is to allow an interface for parents, students, and teachers to have a single point of access for submitting and accessing student forms. Her students fill out a daily report on how their day went. It was an exercise in user authentication, authorization, and database design.
